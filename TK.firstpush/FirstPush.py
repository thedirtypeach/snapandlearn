# This Python script serves as the "guts" to this project as this is
# where the real "work" takes place. I'm polishing the notes and readme.md
# file before beginning to create a Streamlit web-app that will require users
# to authenticate before being granted access to our tool. The only downside 
# being that Streamlit is "stateless" and; therefore, may not provide the best
# support for our use-case.

# Eventually I would like to add a SQL database (or database system that easily
# integrates with Python) to allow us to store additional login parameters. The
# idea being to create the simplest form of a login portal to understand the core
# of something so cruicial to protecting data.

# Import Libraries

# Function for Formatting Streamlit web apps

# Function for OAUTH2.0 Authentication (Google SSO)

# Define the main() function
def main():

    # Call other functions!

    # Print some BS
    print(".\n.")
    print("Keagan's a wiz-nerd\n.\n.")
    print("World = 'Keagan'")
    print('print("Hello", World)')
    print(".\n.")
    print(">>> Hello Keagan")
    print(".\n.")


# Call the main function with that one special if-statement which
# basically says to itself, "Am I being double-clicked? If so, run the main function."
if __name__ == "__main__":
